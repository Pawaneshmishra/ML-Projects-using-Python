# ML-Projects-using-Python
These are the Python projects that I made using Python libraries.
Here I used several libraries like numpy,pandas,matplotlib.pylot to implement my model.
This model is one the examples of Linear Regression.
This model can accurately predict the marks a student will get based on the amount of hours he/she studies.
